        <h1>Please not that the calls to the other project that can be installed on the raspberryPi don't work when installed on our server. This causes timeouts, which we can't fix. That's why
        the "new" measurement called makes use of hardcoded meausrements.</h1>
        <h1>This page will teach you everything about the use of the API</h1>
        <p>please note that every API call except for getting all measurements will require basic authentication. You can use the username "Kemme" and the password "t" to authenticate.</p>
     
        <h3>Getting all measurements in the database</h3>
        <p>Getting all measurements currently in the database can be doing a get request through the following link:
            <a href="http://193.191.187.14:11378/StrawberryPiDataservice/API/measurement/">http://193.191.187.14:11378/StrawberryPiDataservice/API/measurement/</a>. This will return all measurements
        in the database in JSON format</p>
        
        <h3>Adding a new measurement in the database</h3>
        <p>Adding a new entry to the database of measurements can be done by doing a put request trough the following link:
        <a href="http://193.191.187.14:11378/StrawberryPiDataservice/API/measurement/new">http://193.191.187.14:11378/StrawberryPiDataservice/API/measurement/new</a>. This will result in a call
        to the rest endpoints on the project that can be installed on the raspberry pi, that will give a new measurement which will be added to the database.</p>
        
        <h3>Deleting a measurement from the database</h3>
        <p>Param: long id</p>
        <p>Deleting a measurement from the database can be done by doing a delete request through the following link:
            <a href="http://193.191.187.14:11378/StrawberryPiDataservice/API/measurement/delete-1">http://193.191.187.14:11378/StrawberryPiDataservice/API/measurement/delete-1</a>. The 1 in 
            the url is here an example for the parameter id, identifying which measurement has to be deleted. The full logical path without filled-in parameter is: 
            <b>http://193.191.187.14:11378/StrawberryPiDataservice/API/measurement/delete-{id}</b></p>
        
        <h3>Requesting all measurements before a given date</h3>
        <p>Param: date in stringformat. The format for the string is: yyyy-MM-dd</p>
        <p>Getting all measurements before a given date can be done by the following URL: <b>http://193.191.187.14:11378/StrawberryPiDataservice/API/measurement/before-{dateString}</b>. {dateString}
            is the wanted date in the format: yyyy-MM-dd. This will initiate a get request that returns all the measurements before the given date in json format. An example:
            <a href="http://193.191.187.14:11378/StrawberryPiDataservice/API/measurement/before-2016-12-18">http://193.191.187.14:11378/StrawberryPiDataservice/API/measurement/before-2016-12-18</a></p>
        
        <h3>Requesting all measurements after a given date</h3>
        <p>Param: date in stringformat. The format for the string is: yyyy-MM-dd</p>
        <p>Getting all measurements after a given date can be done by the following URL: <b>http://193.191.187.14:11378/StrawberryPiDataservice/API/measurement/after-{dateString}</b>. {dateString}
            is the wanted date in the format: yyyy-MM-dd. This will initiate a get request that returns all the measurements after the given date in json format. An example:
            <a href="http://193.191.187.14:11378/StrawberryPiDataservice/API/measurement/after-2016-12-18">http://193.191.187.14:11378/StrawberryPiDataservice/API/measurement/after-2016-12-18</a></p>
        
        <h3>Requesting all measurements on a given date</h3>
        <p>Param: date in stringformat. The format for the string is: yyyy-MM-dd</p>
        <p>Getting all measurements on a given date can be done by the following URL: <b>http://193.191.187.14:11378/StrawberryPiDataservice/API/measurement/on-{dateString}</b>. {dateString}
            is the wanted date in the format: yyyy-MM-dd. This will initiate a get request that returns all the measurements on the given date in json format. An example:
            <a href="http://193.191.187.14:11378/StrawberryPiDataservice/API/measurement/on-2016-12-18">http://193.191.187.14:11378/StrawberryPiDataservice/API/measurement/on-2016-12-18</a></p>
